# Diet-optimization-and-nutritional-grouping
Use linear optimization to minimize the feed cost and enteric methane production with or without nutritional grouping

## Branch Notes

This branch uses **fixed prices** based on the two most important and costly nutrients:

- **Crude Protein (CP):** \$0.59 per kg  
- **Net Energy for Lactation (NEL):** \$0.06 per Mcal

> This approach simplifies cost calculations by focusing on nutrient-level pricing.

In contrast, the `main` branch uses **individual feed ingredient prices**, offering a more precise but more complex cost evaluation.

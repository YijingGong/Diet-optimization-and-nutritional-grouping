# Diet-optimization-and-nutritional-grouping
Use linear optimization to minimize the feed cost and enteric methane production with or without nutritional grouping
This branch uses fixed prices based on the two most important & expensive nutrients - CP and NEL:
cp_price = 0.59  Unit: $/kg
nel_price = 0.06  Unit: $/Mcal

The main branch uses the prices for each feed ingredients, which is more precise.

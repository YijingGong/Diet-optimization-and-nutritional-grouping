# Diet-optimization-and-nutritional-grouping
Use linear optimization to minimize the feed cost and enteric methane production with or without nutritional grouping (NG)
This branch (NDF_grouping) is used to explore whether formulating diets based on NDF requirement (in addition of DMI and NEL) during the NG could potentially decrease the enteric methane emission.
